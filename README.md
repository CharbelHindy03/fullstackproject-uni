Project Description: NutriWise â€“ Smart Nutrition Companion    
NutriWise is a responsive web project built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), and Bootstrap. It allows users to search for food items and instantly retrieve detailed nutritional information using the Nutrition API by API Ninjas. The site includes interactive pages like Home, Nutrition Facts, Tips, About, and FAQ, all styled with modern design, animations, and user-friendly navigation. The goal of NutriWise is to promote health awareness, support dietary goals, and make learning about nutrition fun and accessible through a clean interface, API integration, and dynamic features like loading spinners, carousels, and smart search functionality.

I have created also new feature to show user's feedback with styled alert message.
